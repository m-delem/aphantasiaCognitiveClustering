title: "Uncovering spatial and verbal cognitive profiles in aphantasia through 
  unsupervised clustering"
abstract: "Mental images are a ubiquitous phenomenon for many people. In recent 
  years, attention has focused on a condition defined by the absence of mental 
  images - aphantasia. Individuals with aphantasia are found to perform as well 
  as typical imagers in most areas. Interestingly, several studies have proposed 
  that individuals with aphantasia might have a more 'semantic and abstract' 
  mode of functioning. The present study aims to better understand the cognitive 
  profile of individuals with aphantasia, by examining their performance 
  regarding semantic and/or abstract processing. To that end, 45 participants 
  with aphantasia and 51 controls completed questionnaires and behavioural tasks 
  assessing sensory and spatial imagery, verbal strategies, verbal and 
  non-verbal reasoning, and verbal and spatial working memory. Initial 
  comparisons suggested very few differences between individuals with aphantasia 
  and controls. However, an unsupervised clustering algorithm revealed three 
  clusters focusing respectively on visual imagery, spatial imagery and verbal 
  strategies, and two very distinct profiles of individuals with aphantasia 
  among these clusters. The first profile had low visual imagery but maintained 
  multisensory imagery, and had higher spatial imagery; the other had low 
  imagery across all sensory modalities, and focused on verbal processing. This 
  study shows that individuals with aphantasia should not be systematically 
  classified based on visual imagery only, but characterised according to 
  various aspects of their cognitive profile. This multifaceted approach could 
  provide a balanced view of the benefits and drawbacks of mental images and 
  help us to understand the mechanisms underlying the spectrum of individual 
  differences in representational formats."
