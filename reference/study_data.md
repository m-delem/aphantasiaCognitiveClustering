# Study data retrieved from the OSF project

This dataset contains the tidied data retrieved from the OSF project.
The data has been preprocessed from the raw data files extracted from a
JATOS server beforehand. The raw data is not bundled in the package to
keep it lightweight, but the functions to extract it are available as
internal functions and a code example is included in
`data-raw/raw_data_extraction.R`.

## Usage
