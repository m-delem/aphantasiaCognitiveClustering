Specifically, condition associated reduction autobiographical memory (Dawes et al., 2020, 2022; Milton et al., 2021; Monzel, Leelaarporn, et al., 2023), lack temporal future imagination (Milton et al., 2021), increased prosopagnosia (Milton et al., 2021; Palermo et al., 2022; Zeman et al., 2020), reduced dreams (Dawes et al., 2020), decreased motor simulation (Dupont et al., 2024). focus deficits left potential positive aspects aphantasia largely unexplored, even though empirical evidence recent studies shown individuals aphantasia performed well “typical” visual imagery various types tasks presumed require ability, visual visuo-spatial working memory (Keogh et al., 2021; Pounder et al., 2022; Reeder et al., 2024). Research hinted advantages aphantasia focused mainly emotional processing. Individuals aphantasia shown less prone sensory sensitivity (Dance et al., 2021), less reactive reading frightening scenarios (Wicken et al., 2021), less sensible intrusive memories (Keogh et al., 2023) suggesting aphantasia help reduce sensory overwhelm, potentially protect emotional overreaction. Recently, Monzel et al. (2023) proposed aphantasia understood within framework “neurodivergence” state representing atypical functional cognitive processing, advantages disadvantages. specifics “alternative thinking” advantages, however, remain understood. Interestingly, Zeman et al. (2020) found individuals aphantasia seemed likely work STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), whereas hyperphantasics, end spectrum, likely work art-related professions. Drawing patterns emerging large-scale exploratory survey, Zeman et al. (2020) proposed broad hypothesis , whereas hyperphantasia might characterized episodic sensorily-rich mode thinking, aphantasia might characterized semantic fact-oriented approach. results conclusions Zeman et al. (2020) similar Object-Spatial-Verbal model cognitive styles developed Blazhenkova & Kozhevnikov (2009) associated questionnaire (Object-Spatial Imagery Verbal Questionnaire, OSIVQ). Based behavioural neuroimaging studies healthy individuals (Kosslyn et al., 1995; Kozhevnikov et al., 2002; Wallace, 1990) neuropsychological studies brain-damaged patients (Bartolomeo, 2002; Farah et al., 1988), Blazhenkova et al. (2006) showed visual-object imagery (imagery colors, shapes, brightness, etc.) dissociated spatial imagery (imagery location, movement orientation). Blazhenkova & Kozhevnikov (2009) challenged prevailing Visualizer-Verbalizer model cognitive styles (Paivio & Ernest, 1971; Richardson, 1977) introduce spatial dimension major form imagery cognitive style right, alongside visual verbal styles. showed several widely used paradigms, Mental Rotation Task (Shepard & Metzler, 1971) Paper Folding Test (Ekstrom, 1976), often considered visual, associated visual imagery visual cognitive styles per se, spatial imagery spatial cognitive styles (Blazhenkova et al., 2006; Blazhenkova & Kozhevnikov, 2009; Kozhevnikov et al., 2010; Vannucci et al., 2006). Consistent observation Zeman et al. (2020) prevalence STEM occupations aphantasia artists hyperphantasia, several studies Object-Spatial-Verbal model shown visual-object cognitive styles particularly prevalent among visual artists, spatial styles -represented scientific fields verbal styles prevail literature humanities, among students professionals (Blazhenkova et al., 2006; Blazhenkova & Kozhevnikov, 2009, 2010; Kozhevnikov et al., 2005; Kozhevnikov et al., 2010). results corroborated various studies showing spatial imagery preserved enhanced aphantasia, subjective spatial scale Object-Spatial Imagery Questionnaire (OSIQ, first version OSIVQ without verbal scale, Blazhenkova et al., 2006) various spatial rotation, manipulation spatial working memory tasks (Bainbridge et al., 2021; Dawes et al., 2020; Keogh et al., 2021; Keogh & Pearson, 2018; Pounder et al., 2022; Reeder et al., 2024; Zeman et al., 2015). Several studies also revealed wide range spatial, sensorimotor/kinaesthetic, verbal amodal memory strategies reported individuals aphantasia (supposedly) visual tasks (Keogh et al., 2021; Reeder et al., 2024; Zeman et al., 2020). diversity modes thinking therefore distributed across several dimensions, including visual-object spatial representation, potentially extending verbal semantic domains. verbal (“propositional”) aspect representations cognitive strategies, although often mentioned potential candidate alternative strategies visual aphantasia, scarcely studied. Object-Spatial-Verbal model cognitive styles allow study verbal representations coherent framework alongside visual spatial imagery shed light cognitive strategies individuals aphantasia. Therefore, objective present study two-fold: () explore cognitive profiles individuals aphantasia using Object-Spatial-Verbal model imagery cognitive styles theorised Blazhenkova & Kozhevnikov (2009), (b) explore whether profiles might related cognitive performance. hypothesised individuals aphantasia tend adopt spatial verbal cognitive profiles, profiles associated specific performance patterns. First, hypothesised profiles might related reasoning performance. Spatial imagery known involved play major role abstract reasoning (Wai et al., 2009). context, absence visual imagery aphantasia priority focus spatial representations aphantasia (Bainbridge et al., 2021; Keogh et al., 2021; Reeder et al., 2024) hypothesised facilitate abstract reasoning. Second, hypothesised spatial verbal cognitive profiles explain individual differences working memory performance, depending modality involved. Previous studies failed find differences working memory performance individuals aphantasia controls (e.g., Keogh et al., 2021; Pounder et al., 2022; Reeder et al., 2024), took account variations visual-object dimension imagery. Accounting use spatial verbal representations working memory provide insight processes strategies underlying performance individuals aphantasia various tasks (Pearson & Keogh, 2019). Third, put forward general hypothesis individuals aphantasia distinct verbal cognitive profiles, good reading comprehension skills. However, studies established positive correlation reading comprehension visual mental imagery (e.g., Suggate & Lenhard, 2022), suggesting central role latter. date specific study reading comprehension ecological context aphantasia provide definitive answer advantages disadvantages aphantasia complex reading tasks involving verbal skills, working memory mental imagery. Finally, hypothesised performance individuals aphantasia tasks supposed require visual imagery might linked greater flexibility switching alternative strategies (e.g. propositional, motor, etc.). case, characterised particularly efficient executive functioning. Thus, present study also included task designed probe executive functions. sum, present study aimed gain better understanding cognitive profiles individuals aphantasia strategies representing processing information. sought identify patterns performance accomplishing various cognitive tasks individuals aphantasia controls relate subjective preferences visual, spatial verbal processing. end, online study designed, integrating questionnaires behavioural tasks assess visual imagery, spatial imagery, verbal strategies, spatial, verbal non-verbal reasoning, verbal visuo-spatial working memory, reading comprehension, executive functions. Based previous work showing differences cognitive performance individuals aphantasia controls (Keogh et al., 2021; Knight et al., 2022; Pounder et al., 2022), expected dividing participants two groups according visual imagery ability fully explain substantial differences task performance. Thus, planned explore hypothesis hidden sub-groups within sample using data-driven unsupervised clustering method. analysis included measures cognitive abilities assess similarities differences participants. proposed data analysis plan resulted clusters characterized visual, spatial, verbal cognitive styles, able explain task performance. light patterns, discuss potential Object-Spatial-Verbal model understanding cognitive processes strategies aphantasia.","code":""},{"path":"https://m-delem.github.io/aphantasiaCognitiveClustering/articles/manuscript.html","id":"methods","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Methods","title":"Reproducible manuscript","text":"part study procedures analysis plan preregistered prior research undertaken. report data exclusions, inclusion/exclusion criteria, manipulations, measures study.

Additionally, reasoning, working memory, executive functioning, reading comprehension assessed battery behavioural tasks. initial analyses, comparing individuals aphantasia controls based conventional measures, revealed significant differences performance. individuals aphantasia demonstrated reduced sensory imagery stronger reliance verbal strategies, differences spatial imagery cognitive tasks, reasoning memory, minimal. findings aligned previous research emphasizing limited impact aphantasia many behavioural tasks (e.g., Bainbridge et al., 2021; Keogh et al., 2021; Knight et al., 2022; Pounder et al., 2022). However, clustering analysis using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) identified cluster structure within dataset. leveraging variables related visual, sensory, spatial imagery, verbal strategies, cognitive abilities (.e., Raven matrices, digit span, spatial span, verbal reasoning), algorithm suggested presence three distinct cognitive profiles, unique characteristics visual, sensory, spatial imagery, well verbal strategies. One cluster, exclusively composed controls, demonstrated high visual sensory imagery, strongly relying visual-object representations. Another mixed cluster, including individuals aphantasia controls, exhibited strong spatial imagery performed best spatial span verbal reasoning tasks. final cluster consisted entirely individuals aphantasia, displayed multisensory aphantasia (reduced sensory, auditory, visual imagery) reliance verbal strategies. clustering revealed complex, multidimensional patterns cognitive abilities imagery preferences extended beyond binary categorization aphantasia versus control, offering rich nuanced picture relationships mental imagery cognition. focus Control participants, cluster analyses revealed important subgroup distinctions. Controls divided two subgroups: one highly vivid visual imagery reduced spatial imagery (cluster C) another opposite pattern, characterized stronger spatial imagery (cluster BCB_{C}). distinctions held important implications task performance. Individuals higher spatial imagery outperformed counterparts stronger visual imagery tasks requiring reasoning working memory, spatial span verbal reasoning tasks. Interestingly, groups performed similarly tasks involving non-verbal reasoning (Raven matrices) reverse digit span, suggesting observed differences due overall disparities cognitive ability specific differences imagery style. results emphasize importance spatial imagery abstract reasoning suggest vivid visual imagery may sometimes impede processes. consistent “visual imagery impedance hypothesis” (Knauff & Johnson-Laird, 2002), posits overly detailed visual representations can disrupt reasoning introducing irrelevant information. findings reinforce relevance spatial imagery cognitive profiles also raise questions relationship visual imagery, highlighting potential trade-offs visual spatial imagery capacities, dynamic previously suggested Kozhevnikov et al. (2010). clustering approach also revealed important heterogeneity within group individuals aphantasia. shared absence visual imagery defined participants aphantasia, two distinct subgroups emerged: one relied heavily spatial strategies (“spatialisers”) another depended predominantly verbal processing (“verbalisers”). Spatialisers demonstrated preserved sensory auditory imagery demonstrated strong performance tasks emphasized spatial representation, mental rotation spatial manipulation tasks. Verbalisers, contrast, exhibited described “multisensory aphantasia” reporting absence visual imagery also reduced absent sensory auditory imagery. group relied heavily verbal strategies, preference linguistic forms information processing. distinction “multisensory aphantasia” “visual-aphantasia” aligns prior clustering study conducted Dawes et al. (2023), highlighted heterogeneity aphantasia across larger samples. However, findings uncover another relevant dimension linking imagery profiles different cognitive styles: verbal versus spatial. strong performance spatialisers spatial tasks supports prior work suggesting many classic “mental imagery tasks”, Mental Rotation Task (Shepard & Metzler, 1971), Paper Folding Test (Ekstrom, 1976) rely heavily spatial visual-object imagery (Blazhenkova & Kozhevnikov, 2009; Bled & Bouvet, 2021; Borst & Kosslyn, 2010; Haciomeroglu, 2016; e.g., Kozhevnikov et al., 2005; Kozhevnikov et al., 2010). Furthermore, findings cognitive styles provide insights individuals aphantasia perform well spatial reasoning tasks, echoing earlier work amodal nature spatial representations (Johnson-Laird, 2010) spatial imagery aphantasia (Palermo et al., 2022). Nuances spatial imagery cognitive styles among individuals aphantasia may also related presence absence unconscious visual representations, phenomenon currently debated literature (see Krempel & Monzel, 2024; Muraki et al., 2023; Purkart et al., 2024). respect, unsupervised clustering unveil previously unrecognised heterogeneities within visual imagery groups, offering novel insights cognitive architectures underlying mental representations. spatial verbal profiles observed aphantasia profiles also broader implications beyond cognitive processes task performance. Zeman et al. (2020) noted disproportionate representation individuals aphantasia STEM fields, may reflect influence spatial profiles among individuals visual aphantasia. Indeed, numerous studies associations OSIVQ categories occupation, study activity found correlations three visual-object, spatial verbal dimensions areas specialisation visual arts, science humanities, respectively (extended review, see Blazhenkova & Pechenkova, 2019). patterns suggest cognitive profiles encompassing spatial verbal dimensions relevant understand consequences aphantasia ecological contexts, supported recent findings linking OSIVQ-derived profiles real-world problem-solving abilities (Chkhaidze et al., 2023; Höffler et al., 2017). Aphantasia may represent one extreme among many larger, multidimensional cognitive spectrum, individual differences imagery cognitive style influence cognitive abilities, subjective experience daily life. Since first systematic investigation aphantasia (Zeman et al., 2015), individuals condition reported “compensatory strengths verbal, mathematical logical domains”, understanding cognitive strengths weaknesses associated aphantasia remains incomplete. profiles identified study offer potential framework explore compensatory mechanisms , several limitations must acknowledged. use unsupervised clustering algorithm allowed discovery hidden structures data, findings remain exploratory require replication larger, diverse samples. Moreover, tasks used assess mental imagery reasoning selected provide broad coverage cognitive abilities may captured full complexity constructs. Future research aim refine measurement visual, spatial, verbal imagery use tasks specifically designed disentangle dimensions. Furthermore, remains seen whether profiles identified can validated behavioural neural phenomena, differences brain activity visual spatial imagery tasks. Overall, findings study suggest variations visual, spatial, verbal cognitive styles offer rich framework understanding “phantasia continuum”. framework highlights heterogeneity within aphantasia population also situates aphantasia within broader spectrum cognitive abilities. Ultimately, moving beyond binary classification aphantasia exploring multidimensional nature cognitive profiles, study aims contribute nuanced cohesive understanding diversity mental imagery cognitive implications. turn, spectacular variability inner experiences represents invaluable source information mental representations, answer long-standing questions nature, modal amodal properties interaction fundamental processes reasoning, problem-solving working memory.","code":""},{"path":"https://m-delem.github.io/aphantasiaCognitiveClustering/articles/manuscript.html","id":"research-transparency-statement","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Research transparency statement","title":"Reproducible manuscript","text":"following elements required reproduce study analyses publicly available Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/7vsx6/): online study materials; anonymised primary data pre-processed data; analysis code notebooks extensive commentary supplementary information exploratory analysis process results. artificial intelligence assisted technologies used research creation article.","code":""},{"path":"https://m-delem.github.io/aphantasiaCognitiveClustering/articles/manuscript.html","id":"author-contributions","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Author contributions","title":"Reproducible manuscript","text":"Conceptualisation: MD, ST, EC, GP.
