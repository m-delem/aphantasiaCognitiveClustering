aphantasiaCognitiveClustering is a data analysis project wrapped in an R
package for reproducibility[^1]. It contains the code and data to reproduce the 
analyses presented in the article "[*Unsupervised clustering reveals spatial 
and verbal cognitive profiles in aphantasia and typical
imagery*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2025.109279)". You can read 
the accepted manuscript for free 
[here](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/ucyb5_v4). 
All study materials are available on the Open Science Framework 
[here](https://osf.io/7vsx6/).

[^1]: The R package structure was chosen to facilitate the sharing of the code 
and data with the scientific community, and to make it easy to reproduce the 
analyses. It is not intended to be a general-purpose package, but rather a
collection of functions and data specific to this study (although many functions
are reusable in their own right). The package development workflow (see
[this reference book](https://r-pkgs.org/)) is also a good way to ensure that 
the code is well-documented and tested, which is important for reproducibility 
in scientific research.

The online documentation of the package contains [an in-depth data analysis 
report](https://m-delem.github.io/aphantasiaCognitiveClustering/articles/analysis_report.html)
describing how to use the package to reproduce the analyses, as well as a
[reproducible version of the manuscript](https://m-delem.github.io/aphantasiaCognitiveClustering/articles/manuscript.html)
with all numerical results generated directly from the package and rendered
using [Quarto](https://quarto.org).

## Installation

You can install the development version of aphantasiaCognitiveClustering from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("m-delem/aphantasiaCognitiveClustering")
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository, launch the R project in RStudio
by opening the `aphantasiaCognitiveClustering.Rproj` file and run the following
command:

```{r}
devtools::load_all()
```

... Which will load the package and make all its functions and data available in
your R session.
